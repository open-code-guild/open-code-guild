# PDF Editor

PDF editor allowing you to view, edit, annotate, change, ... PDFs easily.

## Motivation

There are already some open source PDF viewers out there, however a lot of them only provide basic/no editing of PDFs which is kind of annoying.

## Proposed Solution

Create a Web App to make it usable by multiple different devices and implement functionalities that allow for easy handling of PDFs. Some suggestions can be found below.

Suggestions (incomplete - just a proposal):
- viewing of PDFs
  - importing/exporting
- annotating
  - handwritten notes
  - computer written
- edit PDFs
  - add/remove pages
  - change text
  - add/remove images
